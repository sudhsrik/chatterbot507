I only get paid once a month. I submitted my timesheet as usual, but there was some snafu in the system. OK shit happens, right? I talked to payroll earlier in the week who said they couldn\u2019t get me paid until the end of the week when they finished. Today they they aren\u2019t finished with the taxes and gave me no estimate when I\u2019ll get my check.\n\n\nUpdate: boss just texted me at 8:45pm on a Friday night falling all over herself apologizing. Said she would be taking to HR to find out what happened. Offered to vouch to my landlord.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t need a play by play of their fuck up. I need them to get off their asses and cut me a check. Because that\u2019s what is owed to me. \n\nSecondly, I never once said I was desperate for the money or that I was late on my rent. There\u2019s an inherent assumption that I must be desperate or otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be making a fuss about something that is owed to me.\n\nI still will not work until I get my check. My boss is a decent person and this was not her fault, but she\u2019s the one who has to make payroll accountable. \n\nI stood up for myself and I\u2019m proud of that.
