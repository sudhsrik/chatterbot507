This is my project code for the SI507 Intermediate programming course. 

My project code is currently in a google colab notebook.

I have added my code to this repository as a jupyter notebook .ipynb file.

This will not work if you try to run it as I have not included my secrets.py file to protect the privacy of my passwords and keys,
but feel free to use your own reddit and twitter API keys if you want to use the code.
